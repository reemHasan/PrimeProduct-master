#Notice :I've used django 2.1

For every modivication in model.py we have to alter Django about it by :


1-to let Django know that we have some changes in our model.
 python3 manage.py makemigrations PrimeProductsWebsite

2-Django	prepared a migration file for us that we now have to apply to our database.
$ python3 manage.py migrate PrimeProductsWebsite

#To get into Django' interactive console and try some QuerySet :
$ python3 manage.py shell

>>> from PrimeProductsWebsite.models import Product

>>> Product.objects.all()
<QuerySet [<Product: Product object (1)>, <Product: Product object (2)>, <Product: Product object (3)>]>

#get one product from Product table
>>> Product.objects.filter(price='12.71')
<QuerySet [<Product: Product object (1)>]>
